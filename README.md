This repository is the stepping stone towards a new career in the technology sector, not as a devops engineer, not as a tech help desk engineer, not as a sysadmin. This is where you come to learn the tools of the trade for a software engineer. The vehicle is a c++ curriculum geared towards game development. C++ is a difficult language to master. In addition to being an indemand skillset, it will lend towards easy transition to other languages such as Java, C#, and Python. This is not intended to be a web development experience, however mastery of the material will lend to rapid acquisition of the web development knowledge space. 

Included are a number of predefined questions and tutorials that operate independently of any external device. Designed to be used for those with demanding schedules, this is the self-paced introductory material. 

Like any tech school, the pedagogy will very much follow a controlled scheme of introducing new material, re-enforcing older material, and providing challenges to give you the "technical seasoning" required to cement the knowledge. 

If your head hurts and you need to open the Jack, you are doing it right. 

Graduates will earn a general knowledge of Algorithms and Data Structures, including:

Sorting Algorithms

Searching Algorithms

Basic Data Abstraction

Linked List manipulation

Tree manipulation

Graph manipulation and traversal

This is more academic than pragmatic, and met to be an initial stepping stone. Proficiency will lend towards increased performance in interviews.
