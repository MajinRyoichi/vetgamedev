Hello world is the classic introduction to a language. It prints a simple message of "hello world" to the command line.  

Verify the tech prereqs are met by building the application and executing it:
make
./ex1     (to run an executable from the cmd line, prefix it by './')

afterwards, open the program and walk through it line by line:

vim helloworld.cpp
